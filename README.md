# Browser-3D-Viewer-Template
A minimal template for browser based 3D model viewing using code from kovacsv's [Online3DViewer](https://github.com/kovacsv/Online3DViewer).

Simply replace the sample.png, sample.mtl, and sample.obj in the 3d-model folder with your own and change the file names in the sourcefiles section of the html to match the new file names.
